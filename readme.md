Adds some buttons below the chat box for quickly rolling various flat checks.
* Hold control for secret rolls
* The target button automatically rolls the right flat check based on your targeted token. Currently only checks concealed/hidden/invisible. More soonâ„¢ (maybe)

Adds a button in the combat tracker that lets the owner of the current combatant delay their turn, and pressing it again returns them to initiative (after the current turn).
Has some options:
- Return button can be turned off, so delaying is just a marker
- Prompt-variant: Lets the user select which turn to delay after. Can still return early if they wish.
